This program runs a simple snake game. It takes in a hostname of a server along with the player's name. The player's name 
is used to represent their score, which is the length of the snake. Each time the snake eats a peice of food it will
grow by one unit and increase the score by one. The player is able to use multiple different keys to move the snake:
UP: up arrow key, 8 number pad, 'w' key
DOWN: down arrow key, 2 number pad, 's' key
LEFT: left arrow key, 4 number pad, 'a' key
RIGHT: down arrow key, 6 number pad, 'd' key

We added a help button on our GUI to explain the different features the game has and simply rules on how to stay alive.
We also have decided to not include the zoom feature suggested for the game. By being able to see the entire world, as well
as the other snakes, players can then attack one another more easily. We believes it can add a different kind of 
approach to "winning" the game.

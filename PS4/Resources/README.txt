This GUI project uses SpreadsheetPanel to represent a spreadsheet which can hold numbers, strings, and calculate formulas in the cell selected. There is a 
help window that explains shortcuts and how to navigate the spreadsheet in order to enter contents in the cell. The file menu strip gives options on opening a new
spreadsheet, an existing spreadsheet, saving a spreadsheet, saving a new spreasheet, or simply closing the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet ranges in cells from A-Z and 1-99.

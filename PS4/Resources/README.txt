I corrected all the errors in PS4 by using the grading tests, I then transfered those corrections to the branch PS5 and went on from
there.

I first wanted to make sure that SetContentsOfCell was not reapeating any work. I started off calculating the values of cells after they
had already been made, but then changed it so that it would calculate after adding the cell's contents. I also wanted to approach the save 
method first to understand then exactly what I would be reading in, when called in the constructor.
